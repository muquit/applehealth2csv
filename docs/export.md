# Exporting health data from iPhone

1. Launch the *Health App* on iPhone.
2. Tap on the profile photo or icon at the top right corner.
3. Tap **Export All Health Data** at the bottom of the screen.

Health data will be saved to `export.zip` file.
Use appropriate techniques to transfer the file to your machine. If `export.zip` is unzipped,
there will be `export.xml` among other files. This program can take the 
zip file or the xml file as input. The zip file is significantly smaller than the xml
file. For example, my `export.zip` is  72 MB for a year and the
`export.xml` is  644 MB. Therefore, don't bother to unzip it unless you need
XML or other files.
